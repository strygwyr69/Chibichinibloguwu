                <h3>• <strong>READ</strong></h3>
                <p>Books are the food for your mind. Read as much positive, empowering books as you can to
                make you mind stronger.</p>

            <p> <h3>• <strong>MUSIC</strong></h3>
                <p>Listen to calming, soothing music to calm your mind. The sound of raindrops falling or just calm

                <p>Meditation is the best way to free up your mind, to get your mind out of all the thoughts you
                don't want. If you cant focus, try lighting a small candle, keep it in front of you, sit and try to focus
                only on the flame and nothing else till the candle lights out. Keep increasing the size of candle
                time to time till you think you can focus without it.</p>
